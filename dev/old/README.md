### Introduction

The concept of a Boolean algebra is a mathematically powerful tool for representing and manipulating logical expressions. In the context of information retrieval, we can implement a
set-theoretic search engine that allows users to craft complex queries in the
form of logical expressions on keywords.

To be a Boolean algebra, we need a set of elements and a set of operations. In
the context of information retrieval, the elements are the documents and the
operations are the logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. The documents are
the elements of the set and the logical operators are the operations of the
Boolean algebra.

A **query** is a logical expression on keywords. A query is a special way of
specifying a subset of the set of documents. The subset is specified by the
occurrence of the words in the query. For example, the query `(AND "A" "B")`
denotes the set of documents that contain the keywords "A" and "B" and the
query `(NOT "A")` denotes the set of documents that do not contain "A". We may
combine these to form complex queries. For example, the query:
```
(AND "A" (OR "B" (NOT "C")))
```
denotes the set of documents that contain "A" and either "B" or not "C".

A document is said to be relevant to a query if it is in the subset denoted by
the query. The goal of the search engine is to return the documents that are
relevant to the query.

However, this approach often falls short in capturing the nuanced relevance of
documents to a query, especially in large and diverse datasets. To address this
limitation, we introduce a fuzzy set-theoretic search by leveraging a technique
that assigns degrees-of-relevance to documents based on the frequency of query
terms within the document, adjusted by the terms' rarity across the entire
corpus (TF-IDF).

Also note that my model of fuzzy set-theoretic search has not been tested
against a real-world dataset, and almost surely will not perform as well as
Elasticsearch or Solr. This is a toy model for educational purposes. Elasticseach
and Solr are battle-tested and optimized for real-world use, and I would
recommend using them for any real-world application. They also have many more
features than my toy model, like the ability to apply the search terms to
different fields, apply different weights to different fields, and many more
features.

### The `AlgebraicSearchEngine` Implementation

Our search engine, encapsulated in the `AlgebraicSearchEngine` class, is designed to process a corpus of documents and support complex querying capabilities using both Boolean and fuzzy logic. The class is implemented in Python, utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and Scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` for vectorization.

#### Initializing the Search Engine

The engine is initialized with a list of documents and optionally customized with specific stemmers, vectorizers, and stopwords. The initialization process involves preprocessing each document through tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal, followed by vectorization to transform the processed documents into a numerical format suitable for analysis.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import numpy as np

# Define a list of sample documents
docs = [
    "The cat in the hat",
    "This is just a document with no other purpose than to show how the search engine works.",
    "A dog and his boy.",
    # Additional documents...
]

# Initialize the search engine with TF-IDF vectorization
fuzzy_search_engine = AlgebraicSearchEngine(
    docs=docs,
    vectorizer=TfidfVectorizer(),
    stopwords=stopwords.words('english')
)
```

#### Executing a Boolean Query

The search engine supports executing queries using Boolean logic, allowing users to specify combinations of terms with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators. This feature is particularly useful for filtering documents that strictly match the criteria defined by the query.

We wish to search for documents that contain the keywords "cat", 
not "bite".

```python
query = "(AND cat (NOT bite) (AND dog (OR quick fast)) (NOT boy))"
# Execute the query
results = boolean_search_engine.search(query)
# Display relevant documents
for i, score in enumerate(results):
    if score > 0:
        print(f"Document {i}: {docs[i]} - Relevance: {score}")
# Output:
#   Document 9: The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy cat.
#   Document 10: The fast brown dog jumps over the lazy cat.
```

#### Transitioning to Fuzzy Set-Theoretic Search with TF-IDF

While Boolean search is effective for exact matching, the fuzzy set-theoretic search using TF-IDF allows us to quantify the relevance of documents to a query on a continuous scale. This method calculates a relevance score for each document based on the frequency of query terms within the document, adjusted by the terms' rarity across the entire corpus.

```python
# Execute the same query using the TF-IDF vectorized search engine
results = fuzzy_search_engine.search(query)
# Sort and display the results by relevance
sorted_results = sorted(enumerate(results), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
for i in range(3):
    i, score = sorted_results[i]
    print(f"Document {i}: {docs[i]} - Score: {score}")
# Output:
#   Document 12: a quick dog bite a cat (0.3161735956168409)
#   Document 9: The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy cat. (0.2714157795710721)
#   Document 10: The super fast brown dog jumps over the lazy cat. (0.2134685886816857)
```

We might be suprised by the results. The document "a quick dog bite a cat" has
the highest score. This is because the word "quick" is rare in the corpus, so

### Conclusion

The `AlgebraicSearchEngine` demonstrates the power of combining traditional Boolean search logic with the nuanced relevance scoring provided by TF-IDF. This approach allows for more sophisticated queries and a deeper understanding of document relevance, making it a valuable tool for information retrieval tasks.
